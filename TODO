1. start points and links

make terrain pointer record and remove from cell

Think about data structure and indexing here . Which will be the easiest to copy and search ? Seems like entry points should go into individual cells

Actually a consistent approach is really needed ... either everything is stored in the cell which makes lookups more convoluted or switch cells to being just place holders for where the user can go and then add a pointer record for everything else. Entry points can be the same but need safeties to prevent repeatability.


2. release changed flag using TS

4. objects and inventory

5. now add special override objects and changes to appi wrapper to accomodate panning and mulitple instantiations of the same file 

DONT FORGET
resource load points (configure in release)
