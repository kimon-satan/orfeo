1. start points and links

Think about data structure and indexing here . Which will be the easiest to copy and search ? Seems like entry points should go into individual cells

{index: 1-x , x: , y: }

then allow 10 possible entry points for each level (not actually created until user sets them).

entry point 0 is set to 0,0 by default

2. release changed flag using TS

4. objects and inventory

5. now add special override objects and changes to appi wrapper to accomodate panning and mulitple instantiations of the same file 

DONT FORGET
resource load points (configure in release)
